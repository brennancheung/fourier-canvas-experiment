fourier-canvas-experiment
=========================

An interactive experiment with the Fourier Transform that allows you to intuitively understand how it works.

The black line is a plot of cos(2x) + cos(3x).  The blue line in bold represents cos(kx) where k is the frequency
listed in the label.

The top contains the frequency domain components.  Mouse over the 2 spikes and notice what happens with the blue line.

Pay attention to the blue line area above and below the x axis.  When that frequency is present you will see most of the
blue line above the x axis.  When the frequency is not present the area above will roughly balance out with the area below.

Scrub the mouse left and right to see how the blue line changes.

Enjoy!
